# Loki source transformation configurations
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# This file contains configurations for multiple source transformation
# pipelines and batch processing settings to apply Loki transformations
# to the shallow_convection source tree.


# Loki batch scheduler configuration
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# The Loki batch scheduler performs automated discovery of call trees
# from a select set of seed subroutines. Whenever it adds new
# nodes to the call tree, the following default behaviour will be
# honoured, unless it is specifically overwritten below.

[default]
role = 'kernel'  # Role to determine how to transform a routine
expand = true  # Automatically expand call tree to subroutine calls
strict = true  # Throw exceptions during dicovery
enable_imports = true  # Chase dependencies incurred via imports

# Ensure that we are never adding these to the tree, and thus
# do not attempt to look up the source files for these.
disable = ['yomhook#dr_hook']


# Call tree entry points ("driver" subroutines)
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Note that Loki differentiates between "driver" routines, which act as
# call tree roots and contain the offload and parallelisation loops, and
# "kernel" routines that only contain compute loops and are called
# from drivers or other kernels within parallel sections.
[routines]

[routines.shallow_convection]
  role = 'driver'
  expand = true

# Explicitly marked "header" modules needed by the C transpilation
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
[routines.parkind1]
  role = 'header'
  expand = false


# Configuration of "Dimension" variables
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Loki uses rigorously enforced variable naming conventions to
# identifiy loops that pertain to a particular scientific dimension.
[dimensions]

# The horizontal dimension that signifies the vecotr dimension
[dimensions.horizontal]
  size = 'NIT'
  index = 'JL'
  bounds = ['KIDIA', 'KFDIA']
  aliases = ['NPROMA', 'KDIM%KLON']

# The vertical data dimension for advanced optimisations
[dimensions.vertical]
  size = 'KLEV'
  index = 'JK'

# The outer loop blocking dimension in the parallel driver
[dimensions.block_dim]
  size = 'NGPBLKS'
  index = 'IBL'


# Frontend argument overrides
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# Certain header modules can only be processed by the FP frontend
[frontend_args]

# Define specific transformation settings
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# The section configures the invididual steps of the transformation
# pipelines. Importantly, it also defines the class name and Python
# module that Transformation object will be instatiated from.
[transformations]

# A set of utility transformations
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
[transformations.Idem]
  classname = 'IdemTransformation'
  module = 'loki.transformations'


# Full transformation pipelines
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# The entries below are mapped to the "mode" entry point in
# loki-transform.py. The define the set of transformation and the
# order in which they are applies to the complete call tree.
